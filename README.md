# openIPC_configurator_python
first try on a configurator for openIPC for any platform

openIPC configurator by default runs on Windows and needs .NET framework. The Windows Version uses a batch file and is english only.

As this is my very first attempt of writing a GUI in python, it is also the first time creating something based on a existing programm.
I hope there are a few people out there, who can help make this configurator work with LiNUX (which i am using), windows (like the existing) and of course MacOS and maybe on mobile devices, which would be awesome for everyone. Who likes to take a laptop to the field, which isn't enough for openIPC.

This software needs a hotspot function as well for mobile devices or something you can use to connect to the openIPC system...
